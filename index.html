		<p> Hello, I'm Anders Long. I am a freshman at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I love coding, running, reading, art, history,
		and about every other aspect of geek culture. My dream is to improve education through technology, either by being a computer science
		teacher or by developing educational games. My current Major is Computer Science, with a minor in Math. <a href = "contact.html"> click here for contact info</a> </p>
